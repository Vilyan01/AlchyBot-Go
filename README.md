# AlchyBot

This is mostly a result of boredom and curiosity. After specifying some commands, fancy things will happen.

## Commands

The initial commands that will be available are as follows:

1. `!drink name Tom Collins` - Find a drink by name.
2. `!drink ingredient Whiskey, Coke` - Find a random drink with specified comma separated ingredients.
3. `!drink random`

The commands are have 3 parts. The first part `!drink` is what the command is recognized by. The second part, either `name`, `ingredient`, or `random` tells the bot what type of search to do. The third part is additional args such as name or what ingredients are in the drink. As a general rule of thumb: `!drink <search_type> <args>`
